# Autonomous Vehicle Reinforcement Learning using DDPG Algorithm v0.5

v0.1 - Working model for model A and model B

v0.2 - Working on model A and model B to the same environment format, where the ddpg actor critic will observe only states 1-3 for model A versus 1-4 for model B

v0.3 - Multi vehicle centralized and decentralized approach

v0.4 - Multi vehicle and multi platoon support w/ inter/intra FRL

v0.5 - Patched reporter for inter/intra FRL experiments, added tunability of critic actor layer
